This is the ukrainian version of Crocodile Game Bot. 

You can test it here: https://t.me/crocodile_ukraine_bot

To set this up yourself, you need to create a `keys.py` module with your
`TOKEN` set up as an environment variable, see
[this](https://able.bio/rhett/how-to-set-and-get-environment-variables-in-python--274rgt5)
as an example.
